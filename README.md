     <p style="font-size: 25">My name is Christopher Mendoza to create these projects I used Photoshop. Using the Phototshop program I was able to create everything I wanted using different forms of techniques that the program had to offer. The Self Portrait photo is actually a picture of my girlfriend that I created using the Andy Warhol effect. The Alter Ego Colloge was a mixture of images split into two seaprate sides to give off the illusion of my good side of my personality on the left and on the right was basically the personality I wanted to have otherwise known as my alter ego. My landscape protrait I used my favorite japanese cartoon and placed him with a beautiful backround of trees in a park. I am looking foward to working more with Photoshop in the future so my acquired sillset could get better.</p>
